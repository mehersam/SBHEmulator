SynBioHubRunner
===============

SynBioHubRunner is the test runner that tests the [SynBioHub] (https://synbiohub.org/) application for compliance of the 
[SBOL Standard] (http://sbolstandard.org/). This test runner can be run as a standalone application, but it's intended purpose 
is to run it using the [SBOLTestRunner] (https://github.com/mehersam/SBOLTestRunner). The application follows the Complex Round-trip approach as described within the SBOLTestRunner. The application takes as input an SBOL data file and performs the data modification steps that SynBioHub performs on an imported file and outputs an emulated data file. Additionally, SynBioHubRunner also uploads the imported data file to SynBioHub and retrieves the exported data file. The purpose of this process is to then use the SBOLTestRunner to compare the two files and identify any unspecified changes and test its overall compliance of the SBOL Standard.  

### Retrieving SynBioHubRunner

1. [Create](https://github.com/) a GitHub account.
2. [Setup](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) Git on your machine.
3. [Clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) the SBOLRunners GitHub repository to your machine.


### Compiling and Packaging SynBioHubRunner

1. [Setup](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) Apache Maven. A tutorial on using Apache Maven is provided [here](http://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/index.html).

2. In the command line, change to the directory of the runner needed (e.g. ```cd /path/to/SynBioHubRunner```) and execute the following command

```
mvn package
```

This will compile the SynBioHubRunner source files, package the compiled source into a SynBioHubRunner JAR file (```SynBioHubRunner-<version>-SNAPSHOT-withDependencies.jar```), and place the JAR file into the ```core2/target``` sub-directory. 

### Using the SynBioHubRunner

The SynBioHubRunner can be run through the command-line by using the following command: 

```
  java -jar <jarFileName> <sbol_file_name> <retrieved_file_path> <emulated_file_path>
```

a. <jarFileName> is the name of the SynBioHubRunner jar file downloaded. <br />
b. <sbol_file_name> is the SBOL data file to import. <br />
c. <retrieved_file_path> is the file path location where the exported file from SynBioHub will be placed. <br />
d. <emulated_file_path> is the file path location where the emulated file will be placed. <br />
